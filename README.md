Solución al reto And YOU can Help Fight Fires! #Spaceapps2017

## The project

The webpage maps the points of the wildfires in the area, making a filter with the latitude and longitude of the country selected, the confidence of the wildfire and the acquired date of the data. Any person can alert of a wildfire by simply pressing a button and giving permission to get their location by GPS. Also, by making the alert on the webpage, automatically makes a tweet on your timeline with the authorities in charge of extinguish the wildfire labeled.​

The next step is to implement a program in OpenCV which can detect wildfires with the drone’s cameras send by local authorities to reduce costs and time spent verifying the wildfire existence.

## To do:
- [ ] Validate correctly the wildfire alerts of the users, in order to upgrade the confidence of the wildfire.
- [ ] Generate a map with the wildfire area pinpointed and publish it in social media
- [ ] Implement a program in OpenCV which can detect wildfires with the drone’s cameras
