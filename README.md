Solución al reto And YOU can Help Fight Fires! #Spaceapps2017

## The project

The webpage maps the points of the wildfires in the area, making a filter with the latitude and longitude of the country selected, the confidence of the wildfire and the acquired date of the data. Any person can alert of a wildfire by simply pressing a button and giving permission to get their location by GPS. Also, by making the alert on the webpage, automatically makes a tweet on your timeline with the authorities in charge of extinguish the wildfire labeled.​

As a next step is to implement a program made in OpenCV which can detect forest fires by means of the drones cameras send by local teams to reduce cost and time spent verifying a wildfire.​
